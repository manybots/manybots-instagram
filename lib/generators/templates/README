Superb! Instagram Observer for Manybots has been installed.

Now what?

1. Edit `config/initializers/manybots-instagram.rb` to use your app id and 
secret (more info in the `README` file)
2. Go to `/manybots-instagram` and start collecting your photos (you might have to relaunch the server)

You can find help on the github page:
